# Storj Bootstrap & Redis Proxy

## Project Overview

This project provides a transparent Redis proxy and a Flask-based worker designed to run on Fly.io. It serves two main purposes:

1.  **Transparent Redis Proxy**: Intercepts Redis `AUTH` commands to allow JuiceFS to connect to modern Redis services (like Upstash) that require both a username and password, while JuiceFS clients may only support sending a password.
2.  **Bootstrap Worker**: Exposes an HTTP endpoint (`/bootstrap`) to initialize a JuiceFS filesystem using Storj for object storage and a Redis-compatible service for metadata.

## Prerequisites

- A Fly.io account
- A Storj S3-compatible account
- An Upstash Redis account (or any other Redis-compatible service)
- [`flyctl`](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) installed locally

## Configuration and Secret Management

All configuration is handled via environment variables, which should be set as secrets in your Fly.io application.

**Required Secrets:**

- `PROXY_PASSWORD`: A password that your clients (e.g., JuiceFS) will use to authenticate with this proxy.
- `REDIS_URL`: The connection string for your upstream Redis service. This should include the username, password, host, and port.
- `STORJ_ACCESS_KEY`: Your Storj S3 access key.
- `STORJ_SECRET_KEY`: Your Storj S3 secret key.
- `STORJ_BUCKET_URL`: The S3 bucket URL for your Storj bucket.

**Example `flyctl` commands:**

```bash
flyctl secrets set PROXY_PASSWORD="a-very-secure-password"
flyctl secrets set REDIS_URL="redis://default:your-redis-password@your-redis-host:port"
flyctl secrets set STORJ_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_STORJ_ACCESS_KEY"
flyctl secrets set STORJ_SECRET_KEY="YOUR_STORJ_SECRET_KEY"
flyctl secrets set STORJ_BUCKET_URL="YOUR_STORJ_BUCKET_URL"
```

## Deployment

1.  **Launch the app on Fly.io:**
    This will create a new application and a `fly.toml` configuration file.
    ```bash
    flyctl launch --name your-app-name
    ```

2.  **Set your secrets:**
    Use the `flyctl secrets set` commands listed in the configuration section above.

3.  **Deploy to Fly.io:**
    ```bash
    flyctl deploy
    ```

### Multi-Process Architecture

The `fly.toml` file defines two processes that run within the same machine:

-   **`app`**: Runs the transparent Redis proxy.
    -   Command: `python src/proxy.py`
-   **`web`**: Runs the Flask web server for the bootstrap endpoint.
    -   Command: `gunicorn src.proxy:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8080`

Fly.io is configured to expose two public services:
- The HTTP service on ports 80/443 is routed to the `web` process.
- The Redis service on port 6379 is routed to the `app` process.

## Usage

### Bootstrapping JuiceFS

Once deployed, you can initialize the JuiceFS volume by calling the `/bootstrap` endpoint. This only needs to be done once.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-app-name>.fly.dev/bootstrap
```

### Connecting with a Redis Client (e.g., JuiceFS)

Connect your Redis client to the proxy's public endpoint. Use the `PROXY_PASSWORD` you set as the password.

-   **Host**: `<your-app-name>.fly.dev`
-   **Port**: `6379`
-   **Password**: Your `PROXY_PASSWORD`

The proxy will automatically handle authenticating with your upstream Redis using the `REDIS_URL`.

### Mounting the JuiceFS Volume

To mount the JuiceFS filesystem on another machine:

1.  Install the JuiceFS client.
2.  Run the `juicefs mount` command, pointing it to your proxy's Redis endpoint:

    ```bash
    juicefs mount -d "redis://:<YOUR_PROXY_PASSWORD>@<your-app-name>.fly.dev:6379/0" /path/to/mount/point
    ```

## Local Development

1.  Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the application. The `if __name__ == "__main__"` block in `src/proxy.py` will start the proxy directly. The Flask app for bootstrapping is also defined in the same file. To test locally, you would typically run the proxy directly.
    ```bash
    python src/proxy.py
    ```
    To test the web endpoint, you would use gunicorn as specified in the `fly.toml`.
